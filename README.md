| `Pre_Automation_Energy_kWh`  | Energy consumed before automation (kWh) |
| `Post_Automation_Energy_kWh` | Energy consumed after automation (kWh) |
| `HVAC_System_Type`           | Type of HVAC system (Traditional, Upgraded, Smart Automated) |
| `Automation_Efficiency_%`    | Efficiency improvement due to automation (%) |
| `Peak_Demand_Reduction_MW`   | Reduction in peak energy demand (MW) |
| `External_Temperature_C`     | Outside temperature (¬∞C) |
| `Building_Occupancy_%`       | Building occupancy percentage (%) |
| `Energy_Savings_%`           | Percentage of energy saved after automation |

### **Understanding HVAC System Types**
The **`HVAC_System_Type`** feature categorizes the different types of HVAC systems used in buildings. Each type affects energy consumption and efficiency differently:

#### **1. Traditional HVAC**
- **No automation** ‚Üí Runs on a fixed schedule.
- **High energy consumption** as it operates even when not needed.
- **Examples:** Basic air conditioners, central HVAC with manual control.

#### **2. Upgraded HVAC**
- **Some automation** ‚Üí Programmable thermostats, improved motors.
- **Moderate energy savings** compared to traditional systems.
- **Examples:** Smart thermostats like Nest, Ecobee.

#### **3. Smart Automated HVAC**
- **Fully automated** ‚Üí Uses IoT sensors & AI to adapt dynamically.
- **Highest energy efficiency** with real-time control.
- **Examples:** AI-driven HVAC systems in modern buildings.
